# GA_Project1: Jeopardy!

## Overview

For Project 1, I decided to create Jeopardy.  While at its surface a very simple game, this project has several hurdles to get over in order to reach a completed product.  Upon opening the webpage, the player is greeted by the game title, a score, and the instruction to select a category and value.  Selecting any value of a category will open a question card with multiple choice options.  Once the player has selected an answer, they are notified if right or wrong, the score is updated, and they are returned to the game board.  By default the game is set to record how many point the player can score in 5 minutes, with wrong answers being worth negative points.
