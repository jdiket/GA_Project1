        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I am</h2>
        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Leader and problem-solver based in NC</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>Software Engineering is problem solving, and it's something I love.  With nearly 10 years of experience in the military at varying levels of leadership, I bring a focused and effective problem-solving ethic to everything I do.  As a husband and father my perspective is very centered on people and the experiences they have in using a product or service.  That people first approach helped me be successful as a leader in military operations and planning, and as a retail sales manager for one of my city's longest running businesses.</p>
            <p>With years of experience as a teacher and someone who loves the academic process, I am always pushing myself to learn and help others around me improve.  After retiring from the military I took advantage of opportunities to improve myself further through education and extended learning.  While studying Engineering and Computer Science I received numerous recognitions and scholarships for my work and earned a 3.5/4 cumulative GPA and 3.9/4 within my computer courses.  At the same time I was helping raise my now 4-year-old son, was Student President of academic honor societies on campus, and was selected as one of four student respresentatives to the Board of Trustees from amongst an over 12,000 member student body.</p>
            <p>My military experience taught me a lot about being an effective member of a team.  As a team member or as a team leader, effectiveness often came down to communication.  With excellent communication skills, no fear of public speaking or presentation, and a deft ability to make concepts understandable I bring soft skills of great importance wherever I work.</p>
